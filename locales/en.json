  "features": {
    "title": "Features That Make a Difference",
    "card1": { "title": "Image Fusion", "p": "Combine images from different modalities (CT, MRI) into a single view, providing a more complete and accurate picture of the patient's anatomy." },
    "card2": { "title": "Real-Time Tracking", "p": "Track the exact position of your surgical instruments on the 3D model and in 2D views, ensuring precise and safe approaches." },
    "card3": { "title": "Advanced Planning", "p": "Plan complex surgical approaches with millimeter precision, using intelligent segmentations that optimize the surgical outcome." },
    "card4": { "title": "Intuitive & Compatible Interface", "p": "Developed with the surgeon in mind, Orion One features a clean interface and is compatible with major CT and MRI scanners on the market, facilitating seamless integration into your workflow." },
    "card5": { "title": "Customizable Instruments", "p": "Easily register and calibrate your own surgical instruments, offering full flexibility to adapt to your techniques and preferences." },
    "card6": { "title": "Dedicated Support and Training", "p": "Rely on our team of specialists for comprehensive training and ongoing support, ensuring you get the most out of Orion One." }

  "workflow": {
    "title": "How does Orion One work?",
    "step1": {
      "title": "Import the Image",
      "p": "Load the patient's CT or MRI scans into the system with just a few clicks.",
      "detailed_p": "Import the exam easily: just drag the file onto the screen, and all views, including the patient's 3D model, will be loaded instantly."
    },
    "step2": {
      "title": "Plan the Surgery",
      "p": "Use the 3D model to define trajectories, mark targets, and simulate the procedure before the first incision.",
      "detailed_p": "The GuideOs platform offers exclusive planning tools. Perform measurements, set angles, draw contours, and segment structures with high precision to optimize and streamline the surgical procedure."
    },
    "step3": {
      "title": "Perform Registration",
      "p": "Correlate the patient's anatomy on the surgical table with the 3D model, ensuring the system's accuracy.",
      "detailed_p": "Registration for neurosurgery is a two-step process: first, capture 3 fiducial points on both the patient and the scan. Then, a surface registration with 10 random points in the area of interest refines the system's accuracy."
    },
    "step4": {
      "title": "Start Navigating",
      "p": "Perform the surgery with the confidence of seeing the exact position of your instruments in real-time.",
      "detailed_p": "Navigate in real-time with 6 simultaneous views (3D, Parallel, Orthogonal, Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal) for superior spatial awareness. Use real-time segmentation to easily identify anatomical structures of interest."
